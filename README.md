## Flat Land Diner

Our project is a spinoff of Diner Dash. Users will play as a waiter of a diner. To seat customers, users are to drag them to desired tables. Once customers are seated, timers will start to indicate their level of patience for having their order taken, food served, check given, and check paid for. By clicking on the tables/food counter, users can interact with customers and pick up food to be served. After each interaction with customers, the timers will reset. If the user fails to serve a customer before his/her patience runs out, the customer will leave without paying.  After customers have paid for their food, they will automatically leave.

The objective of the game is to make a specific amount of money before time runs out. 

Key:
Waiter (user) : person
Customer : triangles
Timer for each customer : exclamation mark (turns from green to yellow to red, red meaning time ran out)
Food : circles
Tables : squares
Top right square : Timer
